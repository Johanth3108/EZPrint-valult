# College Printing System

## Overview
The College Printing System is an innovative solution designed to streamline the printing process for students within a college environment. This system integrates an online portal with a centralized printer and storage retrieval system, providing students with a convenient and efficient method for submitting print requests, making payments, and retrieving their printed materials.

## Features
- **Online Portal**: Students can access an intuitive online portal to submit print requests, select binding options, and complete payment transactions seamlessly.
- **Payment Integration**: Secure payment processing ensures smooth and reliable transactions for printing services.
- **Printer Integration**: The system interfaces with a designated printer within the college premises, automatically initiating print jobs upon successful payment confirmation.
